This repo is meant to be a public space where I can publish scripts I've made in my own time for use by anyone interested.

I started my Powershell Journey in 2019 and have written hundreds of scripts to automate many IT related tasks including fully configuring brand new machines.
Now in 2024 I'm entering a new chapter so any new scripts I make for personal use will be published here for all to use as they wish. 
I'm a believer in open source projects and I love to help others create their solutions.

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions I'd love to hear them!
